# 2019 Robotics Project (Year 10)
For Year 10 C.A.T. : Design a robot using an Arduino. This repository will contain all source code, including the Main code compiled for the Arduino, the Android App controlling it, and relevant prototyping code.

Self-set Criteria:
- [x] - (JAVA) Node position editing application to run on Android.
- [x] - (JAVA) Serialise signed 16-bit integer data from each position into a buffer which can be transmitted to the Arduino.
- [ ] - (INO)Arduino can de-serialise the buffer into an array of data-structures.
- [ ] - (INO) Robot will steer towards virtual nodes defined in the mobile application.

Optional:
- [ ] - (JAVA) Show state of robot in app. (Running, completed, etc)
- [ ] - (JAVA) The robot can be started/stopped remotely from the mobile application.
- [ ] - (INO) The robot will avoid crashes via the usage of an ultra-sonic sensor.
