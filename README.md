# 2019 Robotics Project (Year 10)
For Year 10 C.A.T. : Design a robot using an Arduino. This repository will contain all source code, including the Main code compiled for the Arduino, the Android App controlling it, and relevant prototyping code.

Self-set Criteria:
- [x] - Node position editing application to run on Android.
- [ ] - Serialised signed 16-bit integer data will be transmitted over Bluetooth to the Arduino, and de-serialised into a data-structure the Arduino can understand. (W.I.P.)
- [ ] - Robot will steer towards virtual nodes defined in the mobile application.
Optional:
- [ ] - Show state of robot in app. (Running, completed, etc)
- [ ] - The robot can be started/stopped remotely from the mobile application.
- [ ] - The robot will avoid crashes via the usage of an ultra-sonic sensor.
